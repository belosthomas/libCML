# libCML : SLAM library

# 1. About libCML

# 3. Compilation

## a. Windows, Linux and Mac

We recommend you to use CLion from Jetbrains to build and test.
Otherwise, you can :

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 4
```

â˜• Then, take a break, drink a cup of coffee. It can take hours time to build.

## b. Android and iPhone

We recommend you to use Qt Creator, as it is the most simple way to build ModSLAM on Android and iPhone.

# 4. Execution

```bash
cd build
./modslam -d PATH_TO_THE_DATASET
```
where `PATH_TO_THE_DATASET` can be any dataset (TUM, KITTI, RobotCar, a mkv/mp4/avi/other video file...).
MODSLAM will automatically detect the right dataset format.

# 5. Evaluation

```bash
python3 evaluation evaluation/config.txt
```

The configuration file contains the SLAMs and the datasets to evaluate on : 
```bash
ModSLAM "../cmake-build-release/modslam"
TUM "/home/thomas/Datasets/TUM"
KITTI "/home/thomas/Datasets/KITTI"
```
